      "for me it's the image of the upright piano with exposed strings in the waves. while i mourn for that piano's fate, it's a beautiful image of something impermanent exposed to raw nature+time. and her grabbing the top of it after a big wave at 2:28 is instinctual in a way that sort of transcends the scripted nature of a music video",

      "The idea of doing stop-motion live seems horrificly tedious, and the video really pushed the art of what music videos could be at the time. Without Sledgehammer maybe we don't have Michel Gondry's Lego White Stripes video. That's not a world I want to live in. ",
