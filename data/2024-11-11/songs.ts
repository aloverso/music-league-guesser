      "Like so many others, Falling Up doesn‚Äôt consider themselves a Christian band anymore. This is off a sci-fi-ish concept album and I could give an entire talk on my theories for the lyrics lore. Also, this song‚Äôs intro?!?üòç",

    comment: "The real answer is \"every one of these Music League playlists\" but I'll submit a song that has taken on a special meaning in my family, but isn't the type of music I normally listen to. And so Spotify will say \"On Tuesday evenings you listen to Moody Piano\" when really it's only this song. ",

    comment: "Her other stuff is good but just not my style, but on this particular song I think she nails the early 90's sound that is my soul's frequency (and also she encapsulates early 90's \"Beauty Myth\" third-wave feminism). To reference this week's theme, she might as well say \"vote Clinton-Gore\" at the end. I put it into regular playlist rotation, and of course then Spotify started recommending their \"Teen Beats\" playlist to me. Scrolling past that is a small price to pay for this gem.",
