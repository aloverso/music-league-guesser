      "But their most-played song on Spotify is actually this one. It's still clearly Irish in her voice (my favorite part) and in the lyrics, but the singer Dolores O'Riordan (RIP) kept raising the distortion and volume when they recorded, filled with emotion about a tragic bombing in The Troubles.",
