    comment: "1992 was a tipping point for mainstream punk rock. Green Day put out Kerplunk in Dec 91 & Nirvana is topping charts. In 93, Green Day will open for Bad Religion & both will sign to major labels & put out big mainstream albums in 93/94 (Recipe for Hate & Dookie) & pave alongside NOFX, Rancid, the Offspring\n" +

      "But in 92 we’re still on the verge of it! This album is a stepping stone & u can hear the elements of their later hits here\n" +

    comment: "These days I think we could all use a little more RATM. Heavily inspired by collective anger around police brutality after the Rodney King riots, this song is about as in your face as it gets pointing out the pervasiveness of racism, white supremacy, and authoritarianism in our institutions. Even if you don't dig punk music, it's such a cathartic and energizing listen in the face of the news cycle as of late. \n" +
