    comment: "One of the few Queen songs with Brian May on lead vocals! It‚Äôs about a group of space explorers coming home from their voyage to realize they experience time dilation and everyone they knew is dead. It‚Äôs sad and sweet and a great song and I love that Brian May gets to nerd about his astrophysics PhD in a Queen song. I was so hyped I got to see it live in 2019!",

    comment: "These guys are so comforting for me. I think the first time I heard \"And we all get together when we bury our friends,\" I was shocked, but now it is... also somehow just comforting.",

      "Presenting to you a deep cut from Seven Swans, the album before he blew up. It's a funny thing: a Christian worship song styled in the guise of a lover's serenade. Somehow, even as an apostate five years removed from faith, I find this song deeply moving."

    artist:  "The Fireman",
    comment: "this track with under 100,000 all-time plays is from The Fireman, which was the anonymous persona that Paul McCartney used to release weird, varying-quality instrumental stuff in the 90s. there are 11+ minute tracks with sex moans set to beats, random samples of his own unreleased songs echoed out of recognition, and more randomness. I like this track and the 12-minute one it leads directly into as background music, and sometimes I chuckle that this same guy also wrote \"Yesterday.\"",
