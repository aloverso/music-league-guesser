    comment: "Like Velvet is the intro song to Nao's debut album, For All We Know, and I love that it sounds like velvet. It's short and sweet, and then just as Nao sings, \"it's gone,\" the song ends. It sets the right tone to draw me in and yearn for more, pulling me to listen to the rest of the album (which I gladly did).",
