    artist: "Janelle Monáe",
    comment: "I appreciate Janelle Monae's artistry. What I like about this song is its mixed-genre elements: pop, funk, R&B, and hip-hop. There's also a sci-fiesque vibe to it. The song gives energy, layered with lyrics about freedom and social issues. It's thought-provoking, and while the subject matters may be intense, I think the storytelling allows it to be digestible and challenges the \"I listen to any type of music\" mindset."

    comment: "There are many reasons to not enjoy music like this:\n" +
      "* singer's delivery is often too quiet\n" +
      "* little musical change between verse and chorus so it's repetitive\n" +
      "* sound quality is low but in a pretentious artsy way, not a cool punk way\n" +
      "\n" +
      "But I love this stuff. I love the buzzy life of old tapes. The repeats and muffled vocals are like a painter using grays to paint a sunset and capturing the feeling better than a photo.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "This song from an artist with 621 monthly listeners is a perfect example.",
