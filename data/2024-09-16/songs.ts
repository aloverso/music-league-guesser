      'The change in gears at 3:06 feels purposeful. The transition from an upbeat rhythm to a more reflective tone perfectly aligns with the lyrics, "I might be falling deep." The shift is emphatic and is a powerful contrast to the energy at the beginning.',

      'after the chaos of that first guitar solo (yes, we get two!)... the usual thing for a rock song seems not to be to go right into a slow, mournful chorus arrangement. for me it puts an almost religious weight into the song before launching back into space for the second solo. they put together segments of various song drafts to make this (and originally it was even longer, like 14 minutes!).\n\nalso -- anyone else first learn the word "yuppies" from this song?',
