    comment: "I first heard this on the Lost in Translation soundtrack and didn't until that moment realize that guitar distortion could be used in anything other than either more poppy or harder rock music. It was one of those moments that sort of integrates who you used to be with who you're becoming in a seamless way. It became my gateway to My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Radio Dept., and other now-favorites of shoegaze/dream-pop."

    comment: "Somewhere between 3rd and 6th grade, I had a crush on Lara S. My music identity was that I liked oldies like my mom, but Lara was into rock and punk. The front office's secretary made me a tape of The Ramones. It sounded like noise at first, but I listened to it until it sounded like music.\n" +

      "Then I heard B.O.B. and how hyper and tight it was, with a beat that still makes me want to jump around like a pep rally. The division melted away. I looked for more Outkast, and then found Killer Mike and MF Doom and realized that rap was way more than just Big Pimpin'",

    comment: " i have a terrible sense of the proper names of genres but this got me into indie rock i think? this was in high school and i listened to mostly mainstream pop / folk before this. hearing this song i was hooked! the clipped beat and grungy guitar, the weird melody which feels like a person tripping down a staircase and floating back up. so catchy & i could barely make sense of it and THE LYRICS!! I was a quiet angsty emo teen (who never smoked lol) so singing along to this was extremely cathartic",
